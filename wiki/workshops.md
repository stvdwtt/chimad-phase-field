## Overview

An integral component of [{{ site.title }}]({{ site.baseurl
}}/#benchmarks) is regular workshops and associated [hackathons]({{
site.baseurl }}/hackathons).  Approximately twice a year, a spectrum
of United States and international researchers, ranging from graduate
students to senior scientists, come together to participate. These
workshops help us formulate, test, and revise the benchmark
problems. They are also a valuable venue for gathering additional
feedback, such as helping developers of open-source codes find out how
easily their software can be installed. Significant portions of the
workshops are devoted to discussion, which helps the community become
more integrated and enables us to work together to determine future
needs and avenues of work. [test edit]

## Worshop Schedule

 - **Phase Field Methods Workshop I**; Jan 9-10, 2015; workshop held at
   Northwestern University to discuss code collaboration in phase

 - **Phase Field Methods Workshop III**; May 3-5, 2016; workshop and
   hackathon to implement common phase field problems; [notes]({{
   site.baseurl }}/docs/Phase_Field_III_Booklet.pdf).

 - **Phase Field Methods Workshop IV**; Jan 18-20, 2017; a workshop
   consisting of an Install-A-Thon, a discussion of benchmark problems
   and a tutorial on the Method of Manufactured Solutions; [notes]({{
